🧠 Research Paper Assistant Agent
----------------------------------
🎓 Master’s Final Project — LLM Course

  Model Used: mistral:7b-instruct
  Frameworks: FastAPI · LangChain · Ollama · FAISS · ChromaDB
  Hardware Used: NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24 GB VRAM)


📘 Overview

  Research Paper Assistant Agent is a natural language–driven research assistant that helps users manage and analyze academic papers using an LLM-powered backend.
  It enables paper uploading, internal/external searching, and automatic comparison report generation — all through natural language commands.
  
  The agent integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) frameworks to dynamically interpret intent and call the appropriate tools for each user query.
  
  This project was developed and tested locally on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, using Ollama to serve the mistral:7b-instruct model efficiently.


⚙️ Core Features
-----------------
✅ Required Functions

  1. Internal Paper Search — Search uploaded papers stored in the local database and FAISS vector store.
  
  2. Upload PDF Paper — Upload papers from local disk or directly from the internet (e.g., arXiv link).
  
  3. Web Search for Recent Papers — Fetch recent papers from online databases such as arXiv and Semantic Scholar.
  
  4. Paper Comparison and Report Generation — Compare two papers and generate a structured report including goals, methods, and findings.


💡 Extra Functions

  Uploaded papers are stored locally and can be reopened via generated links.
  
  Retrieved papers (from APIs) are stored temporarily in memory for later comparison.
  
  Comparison reports can be exported to PDF.
  
  Display all uploaded papers stored in the local database.

🚀 How to Run the Project
-------------------------
1️⃣ Create a Python Environment

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the App

    uvicorn app:app --reload

4️⃣ Access the Web Interface

  Open your browser and visit:http://127.0.0.1:8000

You can now chat with the Research Paper Assistant through the interactive web interface.

💬 Demo Usage

🧩 Scenario 1

1. Upload paper from https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10562
2. Find recent papers about vision tokenizers
3. Compare between the uploaded paper and the third paper found

🧠 The agent automatically downloads the paper, searches for related work, and generates a structured comparison.

🤖 Scenario 2

1. Find the latest papers about AI Agent
2. Upload paper from https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00477v1
3. Compare between the uploaded paper and the first paper found

🧠 The assistant identifies both papers, extracts their abstracts, and produces a detailed comparison report.
